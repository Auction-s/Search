  # NLP Text Processing Console Application
  
  A Python-based console application demonstrating practical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and abstractive text summarization. Built as a prototype to explore the capabilities of the Hugging Face `transformers` library and spaCy's industrial-strength NER.
  
  ## üöÄ Features
  
  - **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifies and categorizes entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in input text using spaCy's `en_core_web_md` model.
  - **Text Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of long-form text documents using the [Hugging Face `facebook/bart-large-cnn`] model.
  - **Interactive Console Interface:** Allows for easy input of text and selection of processing tasks.
  
  ## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies
  
  - **Core Language:** Python 3.8+
  - **Libraries & Frameworks:**
    - `spacy` (& `en_core_web_md`) for Named Entity Recognition
    - `transformers` (Hugging Face) for text summarization
    - `torch` (PyTorch) as the backend engine
  
  ## üì∏ Demonstration
  
  > **Input Text:** (Example from a news article about a recent tech conference)
  >
  > **NER Output:**
  > - **PERSONS:** [Satya Nadella]
  > - **ORGANIZATIONS:** [Microsoft, OpenAI]
  > - **LOCATIONS:** [San Francisco]
  >
  > **Summarization Output:**
  > The original 500-word article was condensed into a 3-sentence summary that accurately captured the key announcement of...

  ## üìÅ Installation & Usage
  
  1.  **Clone the repository:**
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Auction-s/Search.git
      cd Search
      ```
  2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
      # venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
      ```
  3.  **Run the application:**
      ```bash
      python nlp_console.py
      ```
  
  Lessons Learned
  
  Gained hands-on experience with spaCy and Hugging Face libraries.
  
  Learned how to build a text-processing pipeline (NER ‚Üí Summarization ‚Üí QA).
  
  Practiced structuring a console application instead of hardcoding text.
  
  Improved understanding of how to document and publish a project on GitHub.
  
  Future Improvements
  
  Add a GUI interface (e.g., Tkinter or Streamlit) for better usability.
  
  Expand to support multiple languages (not just English).
  
  Integrate with a search API (e.g., Google Custom Search or Wikipedia) for real-time text sources.
  
  Optimize summarization with faster models or on-device deployment.
  
  Containerize the project with Docker for easier setup.
